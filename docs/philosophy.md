# Philosophy

This plugin is designed to solve documentation in **terraform monorepo codebases** &mdash; where terraform practices keep theoir documentation within the module, and outside a documentation tree &mdash; by enabling [Mkdocs] to be include any documentation found in a terraform modules folder. Then when shipping a change to production, merge the documentation together into a single, digestable site.
